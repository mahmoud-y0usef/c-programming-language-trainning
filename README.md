* [Problem statement 
Sherif is a student at Gammal Tech. Indeed, every time he finishes a lesson on the   website, he takes a few hours to do the exercise below the video. 
He wanted to increase his rank on the website, so he started making videos to solve the problems, and posting them on his social media accounts. He sent them to   Gammal Tech Technical Support in order to get his volunteering points. 
The scoring criteria is the following:
The low quality video gives Sherif 1 point.
The good quality video gives Sherif 3 points.
You need to calculate the number of  Sherif's volunteering points.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer L low quality video (L ≥ 0 ) 
The second line of the input contains one integer H High quality video (H ≥ 0 ) 
Output
the total volunteering points](https://github.com/mahmoud-y0usef/c-programming-language-trainning/blob/main/proplem%20solving%20c/proplem1.c)

    After long research, he found his dream university in the UK, but he got frustrated by   his marks. In fact, his marks may decrease the chance of getting into his dream   university. The admission criteria of the university in terms of school subjects
    He must obtain more than or equal 65 in Math ( m ), more than or equal 55 in physics  ( p ),   and more than or equal 50 in Chemistry ( c ). All must be with a total of more  than or equal to 190, or to obtain more than or equal 140 in Math and Physics. Can  you  solve foad's problem, and tell him if he can be admitted or not into his dream  university.
    Input
    The first line of the input contains one integer m (m ≥ 0 ), the second line is one integer p (p ≥ 0), and the third is c (c  ≥ 0).
    Output
    Print if Foad will pass the admission phase at the university or not.](https://github.com/mahmoud-y0usef/c-programming-language-trainning/blob/main/proplem%20solving%20c/proplem3.c)

* [Problem statement
Ahmed was thinking about coding a new algorithm to get the unique values in an array A, which holds repetitive values N numbers. Moreover, Ahmed wants to solve it with a perfect approach in order to send it to Gammal Tech for the volunteering points.

Input
First line contains a number N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^3) the number of elements.
Second line contains N numbers (0 ≤ A[ i ]≤ 10^9).
Output
Print unique elements in the array.
