//Now you know how to assigns a number in a variable, but let's do this better. Required: Write a program that assigns a number in one variable and another number in another variable and prints the two variables between them with a + sign, then print their sum at the end. Example x + y = 15.

    int n1 = 3333;
    short n2 = 120;

    printf("%d" , (n1 + n2)) ;
